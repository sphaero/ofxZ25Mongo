ofxZ25Mongo
===========

Mongo driver addon for openFrameworks

Damned webeditors, just a quick summary of what I was typing\

This is still experimental, it doesn't work with OF (yet)

issues:
* Mongo headers bite with OF
* communication is done synchronously
* it needs a custom Makefile
* because it depends on Boost (issue with USER_LDFLAGS)
* developement is currently only done on linux64
